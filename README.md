# Machine Learning Course

This repository contains my homework assignments and projects from the university Machine Learning course.

## 📁 Contents

The assignments cover a range of topics, including:
- Cross-validation
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Neural networks and backpropagation

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of these assignments was to apply theoretical machine learning concepts through hands-on coding exercises.

## ⚠️ Notes

Some code skeletons (e.g., function definitions or file structures) were provided by the course instructors as part of the assignment templates. All implementations and solutions were completed by me.
